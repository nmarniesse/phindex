# Roadmap

- finish unit tests!
- Move Collection to AbstractCollection and create ArrayCollection, ObjectCollection, ... The goal is to have
more constraint on the items in the collection (can not mix array and objects, can not mix objects, ...).
- add multiple Storage type (GIST, ?). Let the user choose when add index (Btree by default).
- add some tests on performance. Create big fixtures and check results.
- see symfony's ExpressionLanguage and check if we can use for expression.
